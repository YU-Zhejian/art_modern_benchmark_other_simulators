# Benchmarks

Benchmark of `art_modern` with WGSim (Bundled with SAMtools) and the original ART simulator. All benchmarks are performed on a Linux machine with Intel DPC++/C++ compiler (version `2025.2.1 (2025.2.0.20250806)`) with `-O3` and `-mtune=native`.

The GCC build of `art_modern` (Using GCC version `13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04`) is also included for reference.

`art_modern` was linked to Jemalloc version `5.3.0-0-g54eaed1d8b56b1aa528be3bdd1877e59c56fa90c`, MKL version `2025.0.2.0 (20250200)` and Boost version `1.83.0`.

## Instructions

Use `build-others.sh` to build other simulators.

Use `build-update.sh` to build and update `art_modern`.

Use `run-*.sh` to run benchmark.

## Datasets

1. Reference genome of _C. Elegans_ with 10X coverage.
2. Long mRNAs of humans that exceed 500 nucleotides with 4X coverage.

The simulators were asked to generate a FASTQ on both datasets with paired-end reads lengthen 100bp.
